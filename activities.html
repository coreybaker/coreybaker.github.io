          <li class="text-left"><a href="http://www.childrensdiscoverymuseum.net/" target="_blank">Children's Discovery Museum</a></li>
          <p class="act-text">Come experience unique hands-on exhibits, classes, and programs that stimulate your imagination and curiosity. A visit to the Children’s Discovery Museum located in Uptown Normal, Illinois creates a sense of wonder that excites the love of learning in children of all ages.</p>
          <li class="text-left"><a href="http://www.normaltheater.com/" target="_blank">Normal Theater</a></li>
          <p class="act-text">You may remember going to a theater like the Normal (or maybe even the Normal itself) and that feeling of magic- everything from the approach to the ticket booth, the usher who tore your ticket (there’s no turning back now!), the glorious candy counter with more treats than your allowance could buy and those swinging doors that led you on a path to the most terrific experience you’ll always remember.</p>
          <li class="text-left"><a href="https://illinoisstate.edu/" target="_blank">Illinois State University</a></li>
          <p class="act-text">Gov. William Bissell signed a bill on February 18, 1857, to create a normal school and establish the Board of Education of the State of Illinois as its governing body. The bill stipulated that the permanent location would be the place that offered the most favorable inducements. Jesse W. Fell took up the campaign for Bloomington and obtained financial backing totaling $141,000. Abraham Lincoln, acting as attorney for the board, drew up the bond guaranteeing that Bloomington citizens would fulfill their financial commitments. Consequently, Illinois State Normal University was founded as the first public institution of higher education in the state. Established as a teacher education institution, Illinois State has developed into a multipurpose university with degree programs at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels.</p>
